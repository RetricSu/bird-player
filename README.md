# Bird Player

A MP3 music player built with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and Rust, featuring a nostalgic 2000s-inspired interface. Bird Player is originally forked from [music-player](https://github.com/notryanb/music-player) by [notryanb](https://github.com/notryanb) and try to make it a serious daily-used music player. If you miss the golden era of desktop music players, this might be for you!
